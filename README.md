# hugel_bot
Bot I've made for my discord server to entertain its users

To run it, create .env file in bot folder, type in TOKEN="your token", then also inside bot folder create boops, hugs, kisses, licks, noms and pats folders (or customize it in main.py) and put there some images of your choice.
Then run docker build, docker run and you are ready to go.
